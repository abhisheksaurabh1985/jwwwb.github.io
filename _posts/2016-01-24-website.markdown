I have decided to start a website, not necessarily because I expect anybody to read it, but simply because I have found that putting my thoughts on paper helps me think them through.

I guess I will mainly be writing about computer science related topics here, but I could imagine there will be some ventures into statistics, linguistics, acoustics, and music to come. Maybe something else if I come across something interesting. 

Lately I've pretty much only been programming in Python, it's just so... logical? I do hope I can avoid Matlab in the future, not least because that will free up 10GB on my laptop.

```
>>> def hello_world(signature):
...     print 'Hi World! -{}'.format(signature)
... 
>>> hello_world('James')
Hi World! -James
```

I will attempt to clean up some of my old code to put on [my GitHub page][jwwwb-gh], or at the very least put new projects I start there.
